## Data

The data below represent a subset of an experiment investigating the effect of low- versus high-control threat induction on belief in conspiracy theories, which people may use to blame others for their misfortunes.  
Participants were randomly assigned to either a high- or low-control condition (*CONDITION*) and were then asked about their agreement with five different theories. The average agreement score was recorded as *GENERIC_BLAME*.  
Participants in the high-control condition were asked how much control they have over simple things, such as selecting the music they listen to or deciding what to have for breakfast.  
Participants in the low-control condition were asked how much control they have over uncontrollable events, such as being injured in a traffic accident or experiencing a natural disaster.  

Here is the dataset:  

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

blaming <- read_csv("data_files/blaming.csv")

```
