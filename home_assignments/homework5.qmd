## Load Required Libraries and Data

Ever wondered if metalheads have a secret affinity for cats? Some say metalheads are cat lovers, while others argue the relationship is more... complicated. Let's put this debate to rest using data and Bayesian statistics!

First, if you want to see a scatter plot of this glorious dataset, make sure you have the following package installed and loaded:

```{r}
install.packages("ggrepel")
library(ggrepel)
```

Now, let’s load the usual suspects:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(brms)
library(bayestestR)
theme_set(theme_classic())
```

### About the Data

March 29th is **Metalhead Day**—a time to celebrate heavy metal music and culture. In honor of this sacred occasion, we examine whether metalheads and cats have a statistically significant connection.

Our dataset contains information on the population of cats and the number of metal bands in 35 countries. Let’s load it up:

```{r}
cats_metal <- read_csv("data_files/cats_metal_bands.csv")
cats_metal
```

#### Variables:
- `log_cats1000`: Log-transformed population of cats in a country (in thousands)
- `log_metalBands`: Log-transformed number of metal bands in a country

### Let's Visualize the Relationship

Behold! A scatter plot of **cats vs. metal bands**—possibly the most important graph of your academic career:

```{r}
cats_metal %>% 
  ggplot(aes(log_cats1000, log_metalBands)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = flagCode))
```

## Analysis Steps

### a) Standardize Continuous Variables

Standardization is key. Let’s scale our variables.

```{r}

```

### b) Fit a Bayesian Model

Can we predict the number of metal bands based on the cat population? Let’s find out.

#### First, define appropriate priors for your model:

```{r}

```

#### Then, fit the model using `brm()`:

```{r}

```

### c) Check for Convergence Issues

Time for some Bayesian diagnostics. Use the **WAMBS checklist** (When to Worry and How to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics). Are we safe to interpret the results?

```{r}

```

### d) Visualize the Relationship

Let’s see what our model has to say using `conditional_effects()`:

```{r}

```

### e) Check Practical Significance

A relationship might exist, but is it meaningful? Answer both questions using `p_direction()` and `equivalence_test()`.

```{r}

```

### f) Interpret the Results

Now, for the million-dollar question: Are metalheads *actually* cat lovers? Interpret your results, and may the statistical gods (and Lemmy Kilmister) guide you.

**Bonus Challenge:** If you find that cats and metal bands have a strong relationship, propose a wild hypothesis to explain why. If the relationship is weak, explain why metalheads *should* consider adopting more cats!
