In this homework, we will continue working with the synthetic dataset from class.

```{r}
set.seed(5432)
x1 <- c(round(rnorm(40, 24.5, sd = 1), 2), round(rnorm(5, 24.5, 1) - 8, 2))
x2 <- c(round(rnorm(45, 25.0, sd = 5), 2))

dv <- c(x1, x2)
iv <- rep(c("g1", "g2"), each = 45)

df <- tibble(iv, dv)
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(iv, dv)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


Your friend proposed a new model, claiming it makes the difference between group means more credible.
Should you be concerned about these results?

Evaluate this model using the WAMBS checklist (points 1 to 6) and identify any potential issues in the analysis.

```{r}
library(brms)

fit_test <- brm(bf(dv ~ 0 + iv,
                   sigma ~ 0 + iv + dv),
                data = df,
                family = student,
                iter = 500)

fit_test
```
