**Bayesian Analysis of Donut Quality**

### Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to deepen your understanding of Bayesian statistics, the Beta-Binomial model, and how prior beliefs influence posterior distributions. You will analyze experimental data, run R code, interpret the results, and write a short report explaining your findings.


### Part 1: Investigating Donut Quality with the Beta-Binomial Model

1. **Setting Up the Problem:**
   - You own a store and order batches of jam-filled donuts from a local producer.
   - The producer claims that at least 80% of the donuts are filled with jam, but you‚Äôre skeptical.
   - You randomly eat 20 donuts and find that only 12 contain jam.
   - Set the number of trials and successful outcomes in R:

```{r}

```

2. **Frequentist Approach:**
   - Use a binomial test to check whether the proportion of jam-filled donuts is significantly different from 80%.

```{r}

```

3. **Question:**
   - What is the p-value of the test? How would you interpret it in the context of deciding whether to complain to the producer?

---

### Part 2: Bayesian Approach

1. **Defining the Prior:**
   - Define a grid of possible filling rates.

```{r}

```

2. **Choosing Priors:**
   - Try different priors:
     - **Agnostic prior:** 
     - **Skeptical prior:** (you strongly doubt the 80% claim)
     - **Trustworthy prior:** (you trust the producer)

3. **Computing the Posterior:**
   - Use the Beta-Binomial model to compute the posterior distribution.

```{r}

```

4. **Plotting the Posterior:**
   - Visualize both the prior and posterior distributions on the same plot.

5. **Questions:**
   - How does the posterior distribution change relative to the prior?
   - What is the mean of the posterior distribution?

---

### Part 3: Posterior Inference

1. **Credible Intervals:**
   - Compute 50% and 95% credible intervals using the *qbeta* function.

```{r}

```

2. **Question:**
   - What do these credible intervals tell you about the true proportion of jam-filled donuts?

---

### Part 4: Sensitivity to Priors

1. **Testing Different Priors:**
   - Compare the results using the agnostic, skeptical, and trustworthy priors.

2. **Question:**
   - Which prior seems most reasonable given your experience with the producer?
   - Should you file a complaint based on the posterior distribution and credible intervals?

---

### Part 5: Bayes Factor via Savage-Dickey Ratio

1. **Computing the Bayes Factor:**
   - Use the Savage-Dickey density ratio to compute the Bayes factor for the null hypothesis (filling rate = 0.8).

```{r}

```

2. **Question:**
   - Interpret the Bayes factor. Does it strengthen or weaken your case for a complaint?

---

### Final Report

Write a short report (500-700 words) summarizing your analysis:
- Explain the results of the frequentist test and the Bayesian analysis.
- Discuss how prior beliefs affect the conclusions.
- Interpret the credible intervals and Bayes factor.
- Conclude whether the data convincingly suggest that the producer‚Äôs 80% claim is unreliable.

Use plots to support your explanations!

**Submission:**
- Submit your R code, plots, and the final report as a Quarto document.

Good luck ‚Äî and may your donuts always be filled with jam! üç©
